Introduction
-----------

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

### Mixing R and Markdown : a simple example

Some text... and a chunk of R code.

```{r}
7*6
```

How to generate the document
---------------------------------

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Include any plot 

Just like you would create in a normal analysis.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(x = Species, y = Petal.Length, data = iris, geom = c("boxplot", "jitter"), colour = Species)
```

### Cache long chunks

If a step is taking too long to be executed, you can also cache its result. The chunk will only be executed if its code changes.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(runif(n = 100000, 0, 10), rnorm(100000, 5, 0.7),
     pch=16, col=rgb(0.2, .5, 0.2, 0.1), main="Uniform vs normal")

```

### Include code from other languages

You're not limited to R chunks! You can also include: Rcpp, Python, Awk, Ruby, Haskell, Bash, Perl, Graphviz, TikZ, SAS, Scala, and CoffeeScript, etc. More information on the knitR website (http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines/).


#### C++

For instance, with Rcpp, you can include C++ functions and make them available in R code while taking advantage of the speed of C++.

```{r, engine='Rcpp'}
#include <Rcpp.h>

// [[Rcpp::export]]
int fibonacci(const int x) {
    if (x == 0 || x == 1) return(x);
    return (fibonacci(x - 1)) + fibonacci(x - 2);
}
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fibonacci(10L)
fibonacci(20L)
```

#### Python

```{r, engine='python'}
x = 'hello, python world!'
print(x)
print(x.split(' '))
```

#### Bash

```{r, engine='bash'}
echo hello world
echo 'a b c' | sed 's/ /\|/g'
# number of lines
awk 'END{print NR;}' examples_knitR_RMarkdown.Rmd
```
